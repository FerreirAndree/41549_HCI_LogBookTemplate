# [A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification](stage0_planning/a_stage_0_planning_problem_identification.md)
 > 	This stage corresponds to week 1. Describe the overall rationale that leads to choosing the project idea
<!-- For this stage you will need to read this:-->

- Choice of the project idea:
We made a list with a bunch of ideas like the following:

IHC - ideias
- Freelancing (o eu quer que seja)
- Notion Ripoff
- Reservas (Restaurantes, Hoteis, ...)
- Sistema de aprendizagem online com feedback
- Gestor de estacionamento
- Itenerario para limpesa de piscinas

Meio standard:
- Compra de viagens

But since one of our member missed his bus and seemed pretty passionate about it, we decided to choose to do an app that monitors and gives real time feedback about schedules and routes of the buses of one company. For the competitor we decided to choose BusWay, a public transportation company in Aveiro. We called it "¿WhereTheBusAt?".

# [B. Stage 1 - Context Definition](stage1_context/b_stage_1_context_definition.md)
> 	This stage spans weeks 2 and 3. It entails identifying competitors, analyse the most representative using heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough, and understand how users currently approach the problem and their expectations and needs.

- Heuristic Evaluation:
Each of us did an Heuristic Evaluation of the Mobile App from BusWay, giving our own opinions about its use and design.
 
# [C. Stage 2 - Requirement Analysis](stage2_requirements/c_stage_2_requirement_definition.md)
>	This stage corresponds to weeks 3 and 4, running in parallel with Stage 1, in week 3. After having the context, the obtained information is gathered in Personas and scenarios are built describing the vision for the new solution. Finally, requirements are defined.
<!-- Based on the context definition and the devised scenarios, specify the requirements -->


- Building the personas:
We made a persona that characterizes the average user of the bus system and, in consequence, a bus app. Personality, Qualities and Ability Range is well defined and realistic.

We also made up some scenarios that persona might face while using the app and the bus.

>	Presentations will take place in weeks 5 and 6

# [D. Stage 3 - Low-Fidelity Prototype and Evaluation](stage3_low_fidelity/d_stage_3_low-fidelity_prototype_and_evaluation.md)
>	The low-fidelity prototype stage spans weeks 7 and 8. Based on the scenarios and requirements a low fidelity prototype is designed and evaluated adopting a formative evaluation approach




# [E. Stage 4 - Functional Prototype and Evaluation](stage4_functional_prototype/e_stage_4_functional_prototype_and_evaluation.md)
>	Weeks 9, 10, and 11. During this stage, and incorporating the feedback from the evaluation performed in stage D, a functional prototype is developed and evaluated.




# [F. Stage 5 - Discussion and Solution Refinement](stage5_discussion_and_refinement/f_stage_5_reporting_discussion_refinement.md)
>	Week 12. Stage 5 concerns gathering all the data from the evaluation, discuss the findings, perform some refinement to the functional prototype and, if needed, additional evaluation.



# [G. Stage 6 - Critical Analysis](stage6_critical_analysis/g_stage_6_critical_analysis.md)
>	This should be done before the presentation and entails a critical analysis over the whole work that was performed, what were the strong points and what could have been done better.

# [P2 - Second Assignment Presentation](presentation_2/p2__second_assignment_presentation.md)
>	Final Presentations of the project will take place in weeks 13 and 14
