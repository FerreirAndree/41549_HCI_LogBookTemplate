# ![Persona Name](personas/persona1.jpg)  
**Name:** [João Alberto]  
**Age:** [15]
**Occupation:** [Student]  
**Location:** [Aveiro, Portugal]  

## Background  
[Describe the persona's background, including their education, work experience, and any relevant personal history. This should be written as a short, engaging narrative that helps to contextualize the persona.]  
From a very young age, João has always dreamed of being a mechanic and work in his father's garage. Maybe even open a garage of his own. With this in mind, he decided to go to a Highschool in Aveiro, to a professional course. Transportation is difficult, since he lives in 30 minutes from the city by bus. As he comes from a very hardworking family, he's determined to pursue his goals, so he's not someone who would easily back down from an idea. He's a happy, funny and determined little fella.

## Daily Life  
[Describe a typical day in their life. What do they do from morning to evening? How do they interact with technology, products, or services? What challenges do they face?]  
João has a pretty monotonous life. He wakes up, goes to school, jokes with his friends while at it, comes back home and watches some Youtube and plays some videogames. He is pretty familiarized with technology, to the point he even built his own PC. He also has a phone, of course, where he chats with friends and plays some niche games.

## Goals & Needs  
[Explain what the persona wants to achieve in their personal or professional life. What are their aspirations? What problems are they trying to solve?]  
His goals go from being loved by everyone around them, to being a top notch mechanic. His mom wanted him to be a doctor, like her, but he's not the studying type so he refused and is following his own path.

## Pain Points & Challenges  
[Describe the main frustrations, obstacles, or inefficiencies they encounter related to the product or service you are designing for.]  
He has missed the bus once and got angry about it since "there's nowhere to search for real times schedules". Or so he thought. In reality, no one around him knew about the app from the company his bus is from, so he couldn't have learned about it. Things also worked out well until then, so he never worried about his means of transportation being unavailable or early/late sometimes.

## Motivation  
*"Why do they engage with this product or service?"*  
[Summarize their core motivation in a compelling way. This could be a short paragraph or even a strong, direct quote that captures their drive.]
Knowing when and how to get on the bus daily.
