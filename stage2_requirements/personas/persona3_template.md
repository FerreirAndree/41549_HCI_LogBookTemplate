## Background  
[Describe the persona's background, including their education, work experience, and any relevant personal history. This should be written as a short, engaging narrative that helps to contextualize the persona.]  
Silvia lives in a city close to Aveiro, but for her old age she can't drive anymore, so she's forced to use public transport. She comes from a poor family, but since things were simpler and cheaper back in the day, she has been able to live a comfortable life. Currently lives with her son and his family. Unfortunately her husband has passed away some years ago, which took a bit of a toll in her. She is not very familiarized with technology, as she believes it's for "a different generation" than her's. Also she only has 4th grade education, as it was not very common to go past that at the time.
