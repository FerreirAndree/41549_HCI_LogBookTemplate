# Scenarios


# Example of a Scenario:
## Scenario Ex: Maria goes on a Museum Tour

[Maria had always loved modern art, but she often found museum visits overwhelmingâ€”so many exhibits, so much information, and little guidance on where to start. Today, she was visiting a contemporary art museum that had recently introduced an **interactive guide**.  ]

[As she entered the museum, Maria received a notification on her phone, reminding her to launch the app. She opened it and was greeted with a personalized welcome screen.

[As she continued her tour, Maria **bookmarked** her favorite pieces, leaving notes about what she found intriguing.
