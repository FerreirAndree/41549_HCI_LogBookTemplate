# Scenarios


# Example of a Scenario:
## Scenario Ex: Maria goes on a Museum Tour

[Maria had always loved modern art, but she often found museum visits overwhelming‚Äîso many exhibits, so much information, and little guidance on where to start. Today, she was visiting a contemporary art museum that had recently introduced an **interactive guide**.  ]

[As she entered the museum, Maria received a notification on her phone, reminding her to launch the app. She opened it and was greeted with a personalized welcome screen. The system, aware of her general interests in **digital media and abstract art**, suggested a self-guided tour tailored to her preferences.  ]

[Curious, Maria followed the suggested path. As she approached the first painting, the guide vibrated slightly‚Äîa prompt that additional content was available. Holding up the guide, she saw an **overlay** appear on the screen, revealing a time-lapse animation of the artist creating the piece. A small **audio clip** played, explaining the artist‚Äôs thought process and influences. Maria found this fascinating; it was as if the artwork was coming to life in front of her.  ]

[As she continued her tour, Maria **bookmarked** her favorite pieces, leaving notes about what she found intriguing. The system, recognizing her engagement, suggested another exhibit nearby featuring similar themes. Midway through her visit, she received a pop-up asking if she‚Äôd like a **short quiz** on the artworks she had explored, offering an interactive way to reflect on what she had learned.  ]

# Scenario x: Andreia catches the bus to University
It's 8:15 A.M. Andreia is about to leave home to head to University, but it's pouring outside and she doesn't want to get wet. 
That said, she needs to spend the minimum amount of time outside between leaving home and catching the bus‚Ä¶ So she opens up *¬øWhereTheBusAt?* goes to her favorites and selects the line she catches every day to go to Uni. 
Now she can see that the bus is still about 4km away from her stop, which will take roughly 7 minutes, she waits for a while and when it is about to arrive she leaves, catches it, and off she goes.

# Scenario 1: Andrea finds the fastest route to save time
Andreia just got out from the "CRM Management" class (on ISCAA) on a Thursday at 17:00. She needs to rush to her friend's house to grab some things she forgot there the night before to then go home.

She needs to get the first bus passing by the University ASAP but she doesn't yet know which bus she'll need to catch to get there, so she opens up the app, selects her friend's house location (roughly) on the app's map and clicks on **'plan trip'**.

After a few seconds she gets the outline of the trip there with the buses she has to catch to get there, luckily she only needs to catch bus 36.
There she has the option to **select the line right away**, she clicks it, and all the buses from that line currently on the road pop up on the map, she notices there's one fairly close to her, she **checks the live estimated time** for the bus to arrive at ISCAA's stop, it's 3 minutes out.
The bus arrives, she catches it, buys the ticket to the driver and off she goes‚Ä¶

# Scenario 2: Andreia avoids the rain and renews her pass on the go
It's 8:15 A.M. Andreia is about to leave home to head to University, but it's pouring outside and she doesnt want to get wet. That said, she needs to spend the minimum amount of time outside between leaving home and catching the bus‚Ä¶ 

So she opens up ¬øWhereTheBusAt? goes to her favourites and **selects the line** she catches every day to go to Uni. Now she can see that the bus is still about 4km away from her stop, which will take roughly 7 minutes. 

Since it‚Äôs the first day of the month, Andreia remembers that her monthly pass has expired. While **checking the bus location**, she navigates to the **"Buy Ticket"** section, selects her usual route, confirm it, and quickly renews her pass with a PayPal payment. Within seconds, her new digital pass is ready.

When the bus is about to arrive, she leaves her house, spending minimal time in the rain, boards the bus, and scans her pass effortlessly. Off she goes, dry and stress-free.

# Scenario 3: Andrea finds an alternative route because of roadworks
It‚Äôs Friday afternoon, and Andreia is heading home after a long day of studying at the Univerity. She walks to her usual bus stop that is near ISCA and checks the WhereTheBusAt app to see when the next bus will arrive. As soon as she opens the app, a **red warning banner** appears, notifying her that due to roadworks, her usual bus is rerouted and will no longer stop where she is waiting.

Confused, she taps on the **alert**, which opens a map view showing the temporary route changes. The app suggests the closest alternative stop and even calculates the walking distance‚Äîjust a 5-minute walk away. She follows the step-by-step walking directions on the app and arrives at the new stop just in time for the bus.

Thanks to the real-time updates, Andreia avoids unnecessary waiting and makes it home without stress, appreciating how the app helps her navigate unexpected changes in public transport.

# Scenario 4: Andrea is going to the beach
It‚Äôs a summer Sunday afternoon, and Andreia is planning a beach day on Barra. She knows she needs to take Bus Line 24, which runs between her village Arradas and the beach. To make sure she doesn't miss the next bus, she opens the WhereTheBusIs app.

On the **home screen**, she navegates to side bar and taps on **"Schedules"**. From there, she **selects Line** 24 and clicks on the option for non-working days, as today is a weekend. Next, she chooses the "departure" direction to see the bus schedules from Aveiro to Praia da Barra.

The app immediately displays a list of all available bus times for that line. She scans the schedule and sees that the next bus departs in 18 minutes, at 14:20. That gives her plenty of time to grab her sunglasses and sunscreen. 
Satisfied, she confirms the schedule and heads out to her stop.


# Scenario 5: Andrea is going to the beach
It‚Äôs a Saturday afternoon, and Andreia and her friend Sofia decide to go downtown for shopping on Forum. Sofia doesn‚Äôt have a bus ticket, so Andreia offers to buy one for her through the ¬øWhereTheBusAt? app.

As they‚Äôre both in a hurry to catch the next bus, Andreia opens the app on her phone and goes to the **‚ÄúMy Ticket‚Äù section**. She selects the **single-use** ticket option for the bus route they need to take. The app detects their **current location**, they **select the destination** and automatically suggests the appropriate bus line for downtown. Andreia taps ‚ÄúSelect Bus‚Äù, and the app asks her to confirm the destination.

She **confirms** the route and adds Sofia as a passenger. Then, Andreia proceeds to pay using PayPal, and within seconds, the app generates a QR code for the single-use ticket. Andreia **shares the QR** code instantly with her via the app‚Äôs built-in share button. Sofia opens the message on her phone and scans the code at the bus stop when the driver asks for it.

# Scenario 6: Andrea sets bus arrival notification
Andreia is spending a Monday's afternoon studying at the university library. She‚Äôs planning to catch the bus home at 17:00 PM, but she doesn‚Äôt want to keep checking the time or the WhereTheBusIs app every few minutes.

To solve this, she opens the WhereTheBusIs app and selects Line 18 from her **favorite routes**. Once she sees the live bus tracker showing her bus‚Äôs current location, she taps on the ‚ÄúSet Arrival Alert‚Äù button. A menu pops up, allowing her to choose when to receive the alert. She **selects the option** for a 2-minute alert, which will notify her when the bus is 10 minutes away from her stop.

The app confirms the alert is set, and Andreia continues studying. A few minutes later, as she‚Äôs wrapping up her notes, she receives a **push notification**: "Your bus (Line 18) is 10 minutes away." So, Andreia quickly packs up her things and heads out to the bus stop just in time to catch the bus.

# Scenario 7: Andreia catches a new bus line
Andreia just got out from the "CRM Management" class (on ISCAA) on a Thursday at 17:00. 
She needs to rush to her friend's house to grab some things she forgot there the night before to then go home. 
She needs to get the first bus passing by the University ASAP but she doesn't yet know which bus she'll need to catch to get there, so she opens up the app, selects her friend's house location (roughly) on the app's map and clicks on 'plan trip'. 
After a few seconds she gets the outline of the trip there with the buses she has to catch to get there, luckily she only needs to catch bus 36. There she has the option to select the line right away, she clicks it, and all the buses from that line currently on the road pop up on the map, she notices there's one fairly close to her, she checks the live estimated time for the bus to arrive at ISCAA's stop, it's 3 minutes out. 
The bus arrives, she catches it, buys the ticket to the driver and off she goes‚Ä¶

# Scenario 8: Andreia Adds a Route to Favorites
Andreia wants to add her bus line to university to the favorites. She opens the app and searches for the route. As she finds it, she clicks on the tab that pops up and clicks on the star shaped icon on the top right corner of said tab. After this, every time she wants to check that route, all she has to do is go to the favorites tab and click on the saved line. All options regarding that line are immediately available to her with less clicks.
