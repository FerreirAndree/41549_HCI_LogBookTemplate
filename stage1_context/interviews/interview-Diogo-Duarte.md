## Context:

I didn't conduct this interview following any specific questions, it was a conversation between me and my colleague about his experience on using public transportation (by bus, to be more specific) both within a city (Aveiro in this case) and *intercity* (Aveiro -> Viseu \[and back] in his case) 

That said, below I'll write down the conclusions and all relevant points from this interview:
## Interview Conclusions

**User's Previous Experience with Public Bus Transportation:**
	As mentioned above, Diogo has had his fair share of public transport by bus.
	.
	He's used to travel both: 
	- from his city to University's by bus
	- Within University's city (Aveiro) when he's there.

**Tools Diogo has used in the past to accomplish his bus travel goals:

- **Rede Expressos' Website** - *intercity* 
	- To buy tickets
	- Consult routes and schedules

- **Aveiro Bus' Website** - *intra-city* 
	- Consult routes and Schedules

**Frustrations Diogo felt using these tools in the past**:
	.
	Diogo reported high difficulties when trying to understand Aveiro bus' schedules and routes (in his words: *Aquilo é 'bueda' manhoso*).
	.
	He also highlighted that the major problem he faced when traveling by *Aveiro Bus* was to know whether if the bus was coming or not, if it had already passed or if it was delayed...
	.
	The only issue he reported when travelling by *Rede Expressos* (*intercity*) was that they don't specify the port where his bus will be in the station and sometimes he gets confused because there's multiple buses from that company parked and he has trouble identifying which bus is his. (this already falls a bit out of our objective for this project, once we're focusing more on *intra-city* transport)

**Features Diogo would like to see implemented on such services**:
	.
	When asked about what he'd like to see implemented on this services that would ease his experience when travelling by bus he told us the following
		- Outlined the importance of **bus tracking**, some way to see where the buses are at at any time.
		- Told us it 'would be cool' to be able to select specific routes and see all the buses that do that route.
		- He'd also like it to be possible to mark both Routes and Stops as favorite and for the latter one, for it to send a notification when the bus is about to get there.


**Key Features:**
	- **Bus Live-Tracking**
	- **Route Selection**
	- **Add Routes and Stops to Favorites**
	- **Proximity Notifications**
