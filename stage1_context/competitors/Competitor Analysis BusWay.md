## Core Functionality 

**Primary Purpose:** 
	- Allow Users to consult bus routes, its timetables and fares.
	
**Key Features:** - [Feature 1] - [Feature 2] - [Feature 3] 

**Unique Selling Points (USPs):** 
	- If they did what they claim, the Bus Live-Tracking is a Game-Changer in the industry...

**Limitations/Weaknesses:** 
	- The live tracking functionality doesn't work properly, they only track maybe 2 or 3 buses a day (An Uninformed user might look at it and think there are no buses on the road at a given moment, given that they claim to have 'Live-Tracking'.)
	- There's no way to simply select the route you want from a menu or something, you have to select in the map one of its stops so you can access it...
	- When a bus isn't being tracked, you still get the 'probable time of arrival' to each stop based on a fixed schedule (no relation to where the bus is at), once that time passes, it will tell you that the next bus to pass by is the next in the schedule (e.g.: 30 mins away or 1 hour away) when, if it is late (which is always), it is passing by in a few minutes.
